# Hypotenuse Calculator with Unit Input

This is a simple Java program that calculates the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle using the Pythagorean theorem. The user is prompted to enter the lengths of two sides and the unit of measurement, and the program computes the hypotenuse.

## How to Run :

1. **Clone the repository**: Clone this project to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/project_name.git
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
```bash
cd project_name
```
3. **Compile and Run the Java file:
```bash
   javac Main.java
   java Main
```
## Example
```bash
Welcome
To calculate the hypotenuse of the desired triangle, you must enter the length of 2 sides
Enter the length of the first side: 3
Enter the length of the second side: 4
Enter the length unit you use: meters
Your Hypotenuse Length is = 5.0 meters
```
## Requirements
